	  						</div>

	  						<div class="concept-description">

	  						 The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the users computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the users screen.
